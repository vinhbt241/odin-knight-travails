# Knight Travails  

Created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.  

This is a program that calculates and displays the shortest path between two positions on chess board (8 x 8) according to a knight's moveset.  

To use, simply call knight_moves(start_position, end_position). The method will return a 2D array contain path from start position to end position (start position and end position inlude!).  

Ex: path = knight_moves([3, 3], [4, 3]) # => [[3, 3], [4, 5], [6, 4], [4, 3]].
